Advent of Code - 2022
=====================

Some solutions for [Advent of Code, 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

The current ambitions are:

 * Keep pace, solve both parts of the daily puzzle on the day it is
   posted.
 * Set a time box of max 1 hour per day.
 * Have some fun
 * Use at least seven different languages. Languages used so far: SML,
   Haskell, Rust, OCaml.

See [my notes](./notes.md) for a log of reflections for the daily
puzzles (contains spoilers).

Other self-imposed rules:

 * Leave my first solutions as they where during the event (some light
   clean up is allowed). Still, it is allowed to _add_ alternative
   solutions or implementations in different languages.
 * The solution for each day should be self-contained. That is, it is
   OK to use extra packages for a given language, but I don't want to
   make my own AoC library or framework.
